Open Ghidra → your project → load the program.

Click Window → Script Manager.

In the Script Manager:

Click the “New” icon → select Python → name it export_decompiled_all.py.

Paste your script (the one I gave you earlier).

Save it.

Select the script → press the green Run button.

Ghidra will ask for an output path and create your full decompilation file.
